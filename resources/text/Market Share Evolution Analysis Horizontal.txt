Market Share Evolution 
AnalysisMany airlines currently celebrate revenue growth and increased 
passenger volume. They also emphasize metrics such as brand 
recognition, customer loyalty, cost efficiency, and, of course, 
profitability in their communications. 
But is this enough to ensure sustained competitiveness and 
growth in the long run? 
Like any business, the ultimate objective is to maintain or enhance a 
strong competitive positioning. 
A key metric for evaluating performance in this regard is the evolution 
of an airline's passenger and revenue market share over time.

OUR  DATA PROVIDERS :    &
In a previous  analysis,  we examined  airlines'  network  strategies  post -
COVID,  detailing  how  each  carrier  allocated  capacity  across  their  
networks . Despite  robust  current  demand,  it's clear  that airlines  won't  
return  to their  pre-crisis  market  shares,  and capacity  augmentation  isn't 
the sole  influencing  factor .
Furthermore,  in a previous  study,  we explored  the ticket  pricing  
strategies  of each  airline,  revealing  that Low-Cost  Carriers  (LCCs)  
emerged  as the primary  beneficiaries  of the observed  general  ticket  
price  increase  over  recent  years .
This analysis  seeks  to evaluate  whether  the additional  capacity  and ticket  
pricing  strategies  of different  airlines  have  positively  impacted  their  
market  shares  in terms  of passengers  and revenue . Our examination  of 
major  global  airlines'  networks  indicates  that studying  the 20 largest  
routes  effectively  reflects  broader  trends  across  their  entire  networks . 
While  our initial  focus  is on a 12-month  trend,  this analysis  can be 
extended  over  a longer  period .
By delving  deeper  into various  markets,  this analysis  aims  to identify  the 
winners  and losers  in the post -COVID  landscape  reshuffle .

A Stress  Test for airBaltic?
The European  low-cost market  remains  highly  dynamic,  as highlighted  in our 
previous  analysis  where  not every  airline  has adopted  the same  network  
strategy .
Here  are some  insights  into the evolution  of the market  shares  of European  
low-cost airlines :
- easyJet  & Vueling : While  these  airlines  experienced  favorable  market  share  
gains  in the months  following  the COVID  crisis,  recent  results  suggest  a 
contrasting  trend . The more  restrained  increase  in capacity  may  have  
contributed  to both  airlines  losing  passengers  to competitors . Nevertheless,  
they  continue  to maintain  their  positions  at the revenue  level  by offering  
higher  fares  than  other  low-cost and ULCCs  in Europe .
- Ryanair,  Wizz  Air (considering  the entire  group,  not just W6 as presented  in 
our previous  analysis),  Transavia  France,  Volotea : The significant  capacity  
increase,  coupled  with  rising  ticket  prices,  is proving  beneficial  for these  low-
cost carriers . They  are gaining  both  passenger  and revenue  market  share  in 
recent  months .
- Eurowings : Despite  a more  conservative  approach  to capacity,  Eurowings  has 
set itself  apart  through  a unique  ticket  pricing  strategy . While  it may  not have  
fully  capitalized  on the recent  surge  in prices,  this approach  has enabled  it to 
attract  passengers  away  from  competitors .
- airBaltic : Similar  to many  other  airlines,  airBaltic  can celebrate  the growth  in 
passenger  volume  and revenue  in 2023  compared  to 2022 . However,  in 
relative  terms,  performance  could  have  been  even  more  favorable . The PW 
engine  crisis  likely  played  a role,  and operational  challenges  may  impact  
passenger  loyalty . Network  adjustments  might  contribute  to underwhelming  
results,  but these  issues  could  be transient . 2024  will serve  as a significant  
stress  test for airBaltic,  having  reached  a critical  size,  and its performance  will 
be interesting  to follow .

Shifting  tides  in European  airline  market  shares .
In our previous  analysis,  we highlighted  the market  share  gains  by several  
European  low-cost  airlines,  both  in revenue  and passenger  volume . This 
shift  implies  that other  airlines  have  faced  losses …
- British  Airways  & KLM  Royal  Dutch  Airlines : Positioned  as the European  
airlines  with  the highest  fare structures,  primarily  serving  business  
customers,  B.A. and KLM  are currently  making  revenue  concessions  to 
maintain  their  market  shares  in passenger  volume .
- Air France : Experiencing  a more  moderate  increase  in capacity  and 
diverting  some  customers  to its Transavia  subsidiaries,  Air France  
witnesses  a decline  in passenger  market  share  but maintains  its revenue  
position,  suggesting  a strategic  focus  on upgrading  its offering .
- Lufthansa : Adopting  a strategy  opposite  to Air France,  Lufthansa  has 
made  slight  concessions  on revenues  in recent  months  to expand  its 
passenger  base .
- Austrian  Airlines,  Aer Lingus,  Iberia : These  three  European  network  
carriers  have  undergone  significant  capacity  increases  since  COVID,  
strategically  positioning  themselves  to attract  more  passengers . Notably,  
despite  a substantial  hike  in ticket  prices  [link  in comments],  Iberia  still 
offers  lower  fares  than  its counterparts . This unique  positioning  explains  its 
market  share  performance  : there  should  be room  for further  growth  
without  concerns  of overcapacity .
- ITA Airways : Starting  operations  in 2020  after  the discontinuation  of 
Alitalia,  ITA is evidently  gaining  market  share . Its growth  outpaces  that of 
larger  airlines  due to its smaller  size.

12-Month Market Share Evolution
Middle  Eastern  airlines,  who  will emerge  as the regional  leader  in 
10 years : Emirates,  Qatar,  or Turkish?
Middle  Eastern  airlines  have  to navigate  through  various  activities  and factors  that 
demand  a significant  amount  of attention . The local  market  is exceptionally  dynamic,  
marked  by a growing  number  of conventions  and sporting  events . Geographically,  the 
region  holds  a central  position  in numerous  major  flows,  contributing  to its strategic  
importance . Moreover,  the global  geopolitical  landscape,  notably  the ongoing  war in 
Ukraine,  has implications  for specific  traffic  flows,  potentially  prompting  a swift  
redistribution  of cards  in this complex  scenario .
As expected,  Emirates  often  sets the tempo  in the Middle  East,  given  its size and its 
hub in Dubai,  making  it a central  player  in the market . There  are today  four major  
airlines  around  it, each  with  distinct  dynamics :
- Etihad : After  undergoing  a challenging  restructuring,  Etihad  currently  lacks  the 
necessary  capacity  to recover  the passenger  volume  it could  hope  for. However,  recent  
market  share  trends  in terms  of revenue  indicate  a willingness  to move  upmarket .
- Qatar : In contrast  to Etihad,  and as highlighted  in our previous  analysis,  Qatar  has 
been  the quickest  to increase  capacity  since  the COVID  pandemic . Unsurprisingly,  it is 
gaining  the most  passengers  among  its competitors . However,  there  is a potential  risk 
of overcapacity .
- Turkish : Geographically  very  well-positioned  to serve  Europe  or the Indian  
subcontinent  with  its narrowbody  fleet  and North  America,  Africa,  or Asia  with  its 
widebody  aircraft,  Turkish  Airlines  has the means  to reshape  the landscape  in the 
region . Without  delving  into details,  Turkish's  mix of narrowbody  and widebody  fleet  
could  be inherently  more  competitive  than  Emirates'  all-widebody  approach . While  
Turkish  has made  significant  efforts  in recent  years  to enhance  its brand  image  and 
improve  revenues,  it is once  again  very  aggressive  in increasing  its passenger  volume .
- Saudia . Saudia  is contributing  to the complexity  of the situation  by launching  flyadeal , 
its low-cost subsidiary,  to compete  with  flynas  in a highly  dynamic  domestic  market . 
This move,  intended  to counter  a competitor,  is inevitably  impacting  Saudia's  own  
market  share .
As for the low -cost airlines in the region, flydubai is the most aggressive one, 
and its data is not included in this graph to maintain clarity. It has achieved a 
remarkable 17% increase in both passenger market share and income over 
the past 12 months. It will also be interesting to follow the performance of 
Turkish’s low -cost carrier Ajet (formerly AnadoluJet ) and its market share 
evolution against Pegasus and SunExpress  (50% owned by Turkish), two low -
cost carriers losing ground to competition.
In a capacity  shortage  situation,  implementing  fare increases  can 
be tempting  but may  prove  to be a risky  strategy .
The U.S. market  swiftly  rebounded  from  the COVID  crisis,  with  airlines  capitalizing  on 
a robust  domestic  comeback . However,  market  share  gains  reveal  the market's  
maturity,  with  entrenched  positions  for each  airline .
Among  the Majors,  United  redeployed  capacity  more  rapidly  than  Delta  and 
American . This performance  likely  contributed  to United's  ability  to maintain  market  
share,  both  in terms  of revenue  and passenger  volume . In contrast,  American,  facing  
a capacity  lag, implemented  higher  fare increases  than  Delta,  as observed  in our 
previous  ticket  pricing  strategy  analysis . 
Consequently,  American  lost revenue  market  share,  likely  to Delta,  and also 
experienced  a decline  in passengers  who  couldn't  afford  the new  ticket  prices  (and  
probably  shifted  to LCCs  like JetBlue  or Southwest),  impacting  American’s  
passenger  market  share  performance .
Among  the low-cost carriers,  Frontier  and Spirit  have  rapidly  increased  their  
capacity . However,  Spirit  implemented  a much  higher  fare increase  (~27% for Spirit  
vs ~11% for Frontier) . While  these  two ULCCs  were  initially  in the same  fare bracket,  
this is no longer  the case . The impact  on their  respective  market  shares  is clear : 
Frontier's  more  cautious  approach  to ticket  price  increases  has paid  off, resulting  in 
better  outcomes  compared  to Spirit .
Southwest  increased  its capacity  at a higher  rate than  the Majors,  leading  to a 
substantial  increase  in passenger  market  share . Despite  implementing  significant  
fare increases,  Southwest's  ticket  prices  remained  well below  those  of the Majors . 
Consequently,  Southwest  experienced  a neutral  evolution  in revenue  market  share .
Additionally,  Hawaiian  continues  to face  challenges  due to Southwest's  presence  in 
its inter -island  operations . Allegiant  seems  to be enhancing  its offerings,  even  if it 
means  losing  some  passengers . And  the price  gap between  JetBlue  and American  is 
widening,  potentially  explaining  JetBlue's  increase  in passengers  but decrease  in 
revenue  market  share .

Southeast  Asia : Which  airline  will emerge  on top in 2024  
following  a crisis  that reshaped  the competitive  landscape?
As discussed  in our previous  analysis  on the capacities  deployed  by airlines  
in Southeast  Asia,  there  has been  a significant  reshuffling  in the region . To 
understand  the impact  on market  shares,  both  in terms  of passenger  volume  
and revenue  generated,  it's important  to consider  this alongside  the 
evolution  of ticket  prices  during  the same  period .
Some  airlines  have  a positioning  that deserves  some  comments :
- Lion  Air, specifically  referring  to the airline  and not the entire  group,  has 
likely  capitalized  on this crisis  to reposition  itself  against  its competitors . 
Implementing  a healthy  fare increase  has enabled  them  to gain  revenue  
market  share  without  losing  passengers  to their  competitors .
- Cebu  Pacific  has implemented  higher  fare increases  compared  to other  
airlines  in the Philippines . This strategy  appears  to have  resulted  in a loss of 
budget  travelers,  commonly  referred  to as backpackers,  to its competitors . 
Conversely,  Philippine  Airlines  may  have  been  too conservative  in adjusting  
its fares,  potentially  missing  an opportunity  to increase  them  further  and 
maintain  its revenue  market  share . But we can't  really  blame  them ; they  
emerged  from  Chapter  11 only  a few months  earlier .
- Understanding  the dynamics  at VietJet  is challenging  due to multiple  
simultaneous  changes . While  VietJet  is significantly  increasing  its capacity,  it 
is also expanding  into numerous  new  routes  with  its A321neo,  entering  
highly  competitive  markets  where  it doesn't  necessarily  dominate  in terms  of 
passenger  volume . Additionally,  VietJet  has raised  its ticket  prices  more  than  
others  in the region . It will take  some  time  to understand  whether  the loss of 
market  share  is associated  with  this more  competitive  network  or if VietJet  is 
facing  challenges  in establishing  itself  against  Vietnam  Airlines,  which  
appears  to be experiencing  an opposing  trend .- Scoot  must  be analyzed  in conjunction  with  Singapore  Airlines  since  they  belong  to the 
same  group . Scoot's  purpose  is to provide  a "low -cost"  alternative  to Singapore  Airlines,  
creating  challenges  for their  shared  competitors  and,  more  importantly,  ensuring  that 
passengers  remain  within  the group  rather  than  losing  them  to competitors . If Singapore  
Airlines  continues  to gain  market  share,  it could  be assumed  that Scoot  should  contribute  
to this growth . However,  this is an aspect  that we will need  to monitor  continuously  to 
understand  its medium -term  trajectory  and determine  if the Scoot  model  can stabilize .
- As for AirAsia,  which  suffered  significant  downsizing  during  this crisis,  the recovery  
seems  to be underway . Over  this recent  12-month  window,  AirAsia  has started  to regain  
its market  share . It is also true for the other  subsidiaries  of the group .12-Month Market Share Evolution
