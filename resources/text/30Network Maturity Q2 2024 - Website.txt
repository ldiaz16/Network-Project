Airline  networks  are analyzed  to categorize  routes  into the 
following  groups : routes  canceled  in the past  12 months,  routes  
launched  within  the last 12 months,  routes  opened  less than  3 
years  ago,  and routes  that have  been  operational  for more  than  
3 years . For a route  to be classified  as new  or canceled,  it must  
not be operated  by any other  aircraft  type  in the fleet . A 
mathematical  function  then  converts  this classification  into a 
score  ranging  from  0 to 10, based  on benchmark  data  from  over  
1,500 airline/aircraft  combinations  worldwide .
A score  of 5 signifies  an average  level  of network  maturity,  while  
a higher  score  indicates  a more  mature  and stable  network .
