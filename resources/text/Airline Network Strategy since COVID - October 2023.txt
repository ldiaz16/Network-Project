Airline Network StrategyAirline Network Strategy. How do you compare?
While an airline has several elements to consider when 
shaping its strategy, the network strategy remains a 
fundamental component in enabling growth and for 
maintaining its competitive stance. 
While factors like ticket prices, cost structure, and schedule 
optimization offer opportunities to enhance profitability, the 
network strategy often reflects the airlines operating dynamics 
and its capacity to adapt to evolving market conditions.

OUR  DATA PROVIDERS :    &
Our Network  Strategy  Matrix  offers four primary  categories  to segment  
how  airlines  can be rated  among  their  comparative  peers :
- Network  Freeze : These  carriers  maintain  relatively  stable  capacity  levels  
or are returning  to pre-crisis  levels . Their  route  renewal  rate is below  
10%, indicating  a cautious  approach  to new  opportunities . They  might  
focus  on other  aspects  beyond  the network  to improve  profitability .
- Network  Shift : These  airlines  may  not have  the ability  to increase  seat 
offerings  but have  the ability  to adapt  their  network  and explore  new  
routes  due to changing  market  conditions .
- Network  Entrenchment : Carriers  in this category  maintain  their  existing  
network  but increase  seat offerings,  aiming  to protect  and expand  their  
passenger  and revenue  market  shares . Their  goal  is to establish  a 
stronger  presence by entrenching  on the routes  they  serve .
- Network  Expansion : These  airlines  believe  they  already have  a strong  
enough position  on their  current  network  and possess  the capacity  to 
increase  seat offerings  on new  routes . They  are strategically  well-placed  
to influence  the game  they  are playing .
This analysis  is dynamic,  and the current  situation  may  differ  from  that of 
tomorrow . Benchmarking  various  airlines  strategies  can provide  highly  
valuable  information  markers .
This analysis  provides  insights  into various  markets through  our Network  
Strategy  Matrix and the dynamic  changes  seen since  the onset  of the 
COVID  crisis . This matrix  will simplify  how  airlines  are positioned to 
manage  returning  traffic .

Is easyJet  approaching  the limits  of its network  potential?
When  examining  the evolution  of capacity  deployed  by low-cost  carriers  in 
Europe  since  2019  and their  utilization  of this additional  capacity,  several  
key observations  emerge :
- easyJet,  Vueling,  and Transavia  fall under  the 'Network  Freeze'  
category . This is expected  for Vueling,  which  follows  a 'follower'  profile,  
aligning  closely  with  the networks  of its parent  companies,  British  
Airways  and Iberia . Its role is to repel  external  threats  from  other  low-
cost carriers  within  the IAG network . Given  its stable  networks,  Vueling  
maintains  a similar  dynamic . We could  have  thought  the same  thing  for 
the two Transavias , but the facts  show  a radically  different  strategy  led 
by the Air France  group . For easyJet,  questions  may  arise  considering  
its size and comparison  with  Ryanair . Although  it couldn't  increase  its 
seat offering  as much,  it will be interesting  to observe  how  this 'bubble'  
evolves  over  time  as easyJet  grows  its capacity . Will it shift vertically  or 
move  closer  to Ryanair?  Can it significantly  expand  its network?
- Eurowings  and airBaltic  fall into the 'Network  Shift'  category . Their  
reasons  vary. Eurowings  now  operates  from  the brand -new  Berlin  
airport,  and airBaltic,  affected  by the conflict  in Ukraine,  altered  its 
routes,  with  Riga -Moscow  being  its most  important  route  in 2019 .
- Ryanair  remains  the primary  disruptor  in the European  market,  flanked  
by three  'satellites'  challenging  this giant : Wizz  Air, Transavia  France  
and Volotea . All have  clear  ambitions  to make  waves . Wizz  Air 
represents  the main  threat . Initially  launched  to serve  the Eastern  
European  markets,  Wizz  Air opened  three  subsidiaries  to directly  
challenge  Ryanair  in Europe  but also grow  in the Middle  East . Transavia  
France  not only  reclaimed  several  Air France  routes  but also 
substantially  increased  capacity  on them  to counter  Ryanair,  and so far, 
it seems  effective . Volotea , operating  more  independently,  leverages  its 
flexibility  to experiment  with  new  strategies —successfully?

Is Iberia  stronger  than  the European  Big 3 ?
The European  aviation  market  is in full swing,  and the latest  results  from  
the European  Majors  underscore  Iberia's  exceptional  performance . Not 
only  does  Iberia  boast  the largest  operating  margins  among  the 
network  carriers  in the three  major  groups  (AirFrance -KLM,  Lufthansa  
Group,  IAG),  but it also leads  in punctuality  with  the best  'On-Time  
Performance'  on the continent . Additionally,  Iberia  has managed  to 
implement  the most  significant  price  increases  since  the onset  of 
COVID,  as detailed  in my previous  posts  (refer  to the link in the 
comments) .
Currently,  Iberia  is actively  consolidating  its presence  on its existing  
network . Not only  has it already  surpassed  its pre-COVID  level  of seat 
supply,  but its strategic  positioning  suggests  a focus  on 'Network  
Entrenchment,'  where  capacity  is directed  toward  strengthening  its 
presence  on the current  network  rather  than  exploring  new  routes  – 
explaining  its pricing  policy  as well.
In contrast,  Air France  and Lufthansa  are utilizing  their  subsidiaries,  
Transavia  and Eurowings , respectively,  to reimagine  parts  of their  
networks . However,  the strategies  of the European  'Big 3' ultimately  
share  significant  similarities . 
ITA, amidst  ongoing  restructuring,  has a considerable  journey  ahead,  
and the question  remains  whether  its 'bubble'  will move  vertically  or 
diagonally  as its capacity  expands .
As for KLM,  with  accumulating  constraints  at Schiphol  Airport,  there  
may  be limited  room  to explore  new  routes,  suggesting  a more  vertical  
movement  for its 'bubble' .

Air Arabia (only G9 shown here) launched in 2003, flynas  launched in 2007, flydubai launched in 
2009, flyadeal  and SalamAir  launched in 2016. Jazeera launched in 2004.
Are airlines  becoming  wiser  with  time?
With  the announcements  consistently  reaching  record  levels  during  the 
Dubai  Airshow  in November,  the recurring  question  emerges : Is there  
room  for everyone?
While  we believe  our partner  Milanamos  is best  positioned  to answer  
the question  of market  demand,  we can try to analyze  how  Gulf  carriers  
evolve  as they  accumulate  experience . Observing  the positions  of 
various  low-cost airlines  in the region  within  our Network  Strategy  
matrix,  two noteworthy  patterns  emerge : the sizes  of their  'bubbles'  are 
relatively  similar —these  airlines  possess  fleets  of comparable  sizes . 
However,  the older  they  get, the more  they  tend  to shift  towards  the 
'Network  Freeze'  category . It's as if over  time,  Gulf  airlines  find their  
niche  and cease  actively  seeking  new  horizons .
There  is an exception  to this trend : Jazeera  Airways . Launched  in 2004 , 
it seems  to be undergoing  a mid-life crisis  and is actively  seeking  a new  
direction!
For others,  the chronological  order  of their  launch  is directly  linked  to 
their  position  on this matrix . Air Arabia  was the first to launch  in 2003 , 
followed  by flynas  in 2007 , flydubai  in 2009 , and then  flyadeal  and 
SalamAir  in 2016 .
Of course,  the introduction  of new  players  can always  alter  the 
landscape,  and the example  of flyadeal  entering  the territory  of flynas  
will be interesting  to follow . As discussed  in a previous  post  (link  in 
comments),  flyadeal  and flynas  are the only  two low-cost airlines  in the 
world  that have  reduced  ticket  prices  since  COVID . However,  despite  
comparable  sizes,  flyadeal  continues  to explore  opportunities  in 
various  directions,  while  Flynas  understands  the market  it aims  to serve .

If there's  a geographical  region  profoundly  affected  by the COVID  
crisis,  it's the South -East  Asian  area . The lingering  impacts  are evident  
when  examining  our Network  Strategy  matrix . Thai  and Garuda,  both  
on the brink  of closure,  are far from  returning  to their  pre-crisis  capacity  
and network . However,  Network  Carriers  weren't  the sole  victims ; the 
situation  of AirAsia  is indicative . In a forthcoming  post,  we'll  delve  into 
how  AirAsia,  today,  is the low-cost carrier  furthest  behind  in recovering  
its network  and pre-COVID  capacity . Adding  Malaysia  Airlines  and 
Philippine  Airlines,  we have  a group  of airlines  falling  into the 'Network  
Freeze'  category  (see  the link to my previous  post  in the comments) .
While  it might  be too early  to definitively  confirm  this trend,  Vietnam  
Airlines  and Cebu  appear  more  inclined  to consolidate  their  presence  
on existing  routes  with  the gradually  increasing  capacity,  rather  than  
aggressively  seeking  new  routes . Notably,  Vietnam  Airlines  
demonstrates  that the Vietnamese  market  is the most  dynamic,  being  
the only  Network  Carrier  to have  already  regained  its pre-COVID  
capacity .
Singapore  Airlines  and Lion  Air seem  to have  finally  regained  a level  of 
maturity  comparable  to their  pre-crisis  state . This is rather  
disappointing  for Lion  Air, likely  affected  by delays  in MAX  deliveries . 
For an airline  of this caliber,  the time  lost in resuming  its previous  
growth  trajectory  is significant . 
Finally,  in the 'Network  Expansion'  category,  we find Scoot,  but 
especially  VietJet . VietJet  benefits  not only  from  robust  market  growth  
in Vietnam  but also from  subsequent  deliveries,  positioning  it as the 
primary  disruptor  in the region . As for Scoot,  it has thus  far functioned  
as the bodyguard  for Singapore  Airlines,  similar  to Vueling  for the IAG 
group,  protecting  against  external  threats  where  Singapore  Airlines  
operates . With  a stated  ambition  to accelerate  Scoot's  development,  
questions  may  arise  regarding  its ability  to 'break  away'  from  its parent  
bubble!

Picture before the merger of the four 'satellite' airlines of the TATA group (Air India, Air India Express, 
AirAsia India and Vistara), and before the resurgence of Jet Airways.
All against  IndiGo?
We are not experts  on India,  but one must  admit  that it is not easy  to 
follow . GoAir  changed  its name  to Go First  in 2021  before  
disappearing  in 2024 . Jet Airways  vanished  in 2019  but is expected  to 
restart  operations  in 2024 . In early  2022 , the TATA  group  officially  
acquired  Air India  and announced  a merger  a year  ago between  Air 
India  Express  and AirAsia  India  to create  AIX Connect . In the process,  
the TATA  group  announced  that Air India  and Vistara  would  merge  in 
March  2024 . We alter  names,  transform  identities,  and shift  dimensions . 
Will SpiceJet  be able  to keep  up?
However,  one thing  remains  constant : IndiGo . Launched  in 2006 , it has 
become  the sun among  these  airlines —the largest  one,  with  all the 
others  revolving  around  it. 
To better  understand  future  dynamics,  we use our Airline  Network  
Strategy  matrix  before  the merger  of the four 'satellite'  airlines  of the 
TATA  group  and before  the resurgence  of Jet Airways . 
There  are clearly  very  different  cultures  among  these  airlines,  with  four 
distinct  strategies  for developing  their  capacity  and networks . We won't  
speculate  on the future  of all these  bubbles,  but this picture  will surely  
be very  different  by the end of next  year,  and the Indian  market  will 
continue  to be difficult  to read!

Although  Southwest  is more  than  four times  the size of its closest  
competitors,  its network  development  appears  to be in defensive  
mode,  falling  into the category  we termed  'Network  Entrenchment'  in 
my previous  post . While  it has continued  to open  new  routes,  
particularly  from  Chicago  (ORD  more  than  MDW),  Las Vegas,  Baltimore,  
Denver,  and Hawaii,  the rate of these  openings  is relatively  low by 
industry  standards,  especially  for low-cost carriers . Its 'bubble'  seems  
to be expanding  more  vertically  than  horizontally .
JetBlue,  on its end,  has noticeably  fallen  behind . Maybe  too 
preoccupied  with  its future  and potential  merger  with  Spirit,  coupled  
with  a fleet  undergoing  capability  changes  that require  time  to mature,  
especially  with  the gradual  ramp -up of the A220. While  transatlantic  
routes  have  garnered  media  attention,  the new  routes  often  lean  
toward  the south  from  New  York,  extending  further  into Latin  and 
Central  America,  as well as development  from  Los Angeles,  reaching  in 
all directions .
The twin  ULCCs,  Spirit  and Frontier,  mirror  each  other,  following  
precisely  the same  approach . Similar  in size,  the expansion  of their  
networks  shares  the same  trajectory  - quite  distinct  from  that of 
JetBlue ... As Spirit  is withdrawing  from  Denver,  there  may  not be room  
for both  everywhere . The question  arises : can these  two bubbles  
sustain  this momentum  for an extended  period,  with  the hope  that Pratt  
& Whitney  doesn't  act as an arbitrator  between  the two due to a 
shortage  of available  engines!
On a smaller  scale,  Allegiant  and Sun Country  continue  to expand  their  
networks . Allegiant  primarily  focuses  on Nashville  and its presence  in 
Florida,  while  Sun Country  keeps  opening  routes  from  Minneapolis  to 
various  destinations  across  the United  States,  more  inland  than  in sunny  
or coastal  locations!

Ethiopian  Airlines,  a success  story  that nothing  can stop .
Given  the size of this continent,  gauging  the growth  strategies  of African  
airlines  requires  substantial  scales,  leading  us to create  two pictures  to 
better  understand  the dynamics  of the different  operators .
- In the "Network  Freeze"  category,  we have  North  African  airlines  
Tunisair,  Air Algérie , and Royal  Air Maroc,  along  with  Kenya  Airways . The 
COVID  crisis  is evidently  a contributing  factor,  especially  for the latter  
undergoing  significant  restructuring  and aiming  to cut ties with  the 
Kenyan  government  by the end of 2023 .
- In the "Network  Entrenchment"  category,  Ethiopian  and FlySafair  stand  
out. Ethiopian  is already  reaching  120% of its 2019  capacity . Being  the 
largest  airline  on the continent  with  a mature  network,  Ethiopian  naturally  
consolidates  its presence  in its market  without  an immediate  need  for 
new  expansion . A remarkable  trajectory  for this airline,  which  was the first 
affected  by the MAX  crisis . FlySafair's  position  in this category  is almost  
accidental,  seizing  the opportunity  created  by the collapse  of Comair  
and South  African  Airways,  filling  the capacity  gap left by the two defunct  
carriers .
- EgyptAir  is ready  for a new  chapter,  operating  at 100% capacity  with  a 
healthy  10% increase  in new  routes,  a favorable  situation  for potential  
growth .
- In the "Network  Expansion"  category,  we find smaller  ambitious  airlines  
like Air Côte  d'Ivoire,  Air Tanzania,  and notably  Air Peace,  based  in the 
most  populous  country  in Africa,  where  the potential  for growth  is 
strongest .
- Finally,  Air Senegal  appears  to be leaning  towards  the "network  shift"  
category,  rethinking  its network  through  changing  fleet  choices .

Do Chinese  airlines  all follow  the same  growth  strategy?
The intricacies  of partnerships  and legal  structures  among  these  airlines  
make  understanding  Chinese  carriers'  strategies  a complex  task. 
Analyzing  these  airlines  through  our Airline  Network  Strategy  Matrix  
reveals  several  key insights :
- Not a single  airline  falls into the "Network  Freeze"  category . Not a 
surprise,  it is practically  impossible  given  the continuous  opening  of new  
airports  nationwide,  resulting  in airlines  constantly  expanding  to new  
destinations .
- Among  the three  major  carriers,  Air China  has significantly  increased  its 
capacity  post -crisis . Its focus  is primarily  on Chengdu,  capitalizing  on the 
newly  inaugurated  Tianfu  airport  in 2021 . Meanwhile,  China  Eastern  and 
China  Southern,  based  respectively  in Shanghai  and Guangzhou,  have  
concentrated  on shifting  operations  partially  to the new  Daxing  airport  
from  Beijing .
- Among  the 'mid -size’  network  carriers  (Sichuan  Airlines,  Shandong  
Airlines,  Shenzhen  Airlines,  Hainan  Airlines,  and Xiamen  Airlines),  
Sichuan  Airlines  stands  out. The only  one that does  not have  the Boeing  
737 in its fleet  or on order … Coupled  with  the launch  of the new  Tianfu  
airport  in Chengdu,  this is a unique  opportunity  for Sichuan  Airlines  to 
grow  rapidly .
- With  strong  operating  margins,  Spring  Airlines,  China's  pioneering  low-
cost carrier,  is almost  following  a 'network  shift’  strategy  with  nearly  45% 
of its capacity  redeployed  onto  new  routes . Something  wrong  
happening  there  ?

Is it a good  idea  for SKY airline  to join GOL  and Avianca  
within  the ABRA  group?
If COPA  continues  to announce  very  good  financial  results,  its network  
strategy  fits the category  of 'network  entrenchment .' It keeps  adding  
capacity  on existing  routes  to divert  traffic  through  its hub in Panama .
In the 'Network  Shift'  category,  we find Aerolineas , primarily  due to the 
reintroduction  of Austral  within  its network .
With  the exit of Viva  Air Colombia  and its subsidiary  Viva  Air Peru,  the 
ABRA  group  now  relies  on GOL  and Avianca,  the only  two airlines  in 
the 'Network  Freeze'  category . For GOL,  whether  we call it a low-cost  
carrier  or a low-fare,  its position  on this matrix  is low. No wonder  these  
two are seeking  a new  dynamic  with  an airline  like SKY.
SKY falls into the 'Network  Expansion'  category . Also  present  is LATAM,  
regaining  stability  after  bankruptcy,  along  with  Azul,  a dominant  force  
in Brazil  steadily  capturing  market  share  in both  passengers  and 
revenue  compared  to its Brazilian  rivals .
Another  airline  worth  tracking,  despite  its current  small  scale,  is 
JetSMART . Off the chart  for now,  JetSMART  poses  direct  competition  
for SKY and could  significantly  disrupt  several  markets . SKY faces  the 
challenge  of sustaining  its current  momentum  while  collaborating  with  
two airlines  currently  in a weaker  position . Additionally,  it needs  to 
maintain  competitiveness  against  a determined  new  entrant  with  
explicit  ambitions  on other  continents  – just look  at Frontier,  Wizz  Air, 
and Volaris .
For GOL  and Avianca,  it's likely  a favorable  move,  but for SKY,  it might  
raise  more  questions .

Qatar  Airways,  the best  airline  among  all the Big 3s ?
Not surprisingly,  there  aren't  many  new  routes  that the American  
majors  haven't  opened  yet. The U.S. Big 3 can only  add capacity  and 
continue  fortifying  each  of their  respective  fortresses .
Similarly,  the European  Big 3 find themselves  in the same  category  - 
operating  with  a capacity  still lower  than  pre-COVID  levels,  but their  
network  strategies  are evolving . Adjustments  are being  made,  
especially  with  the utilization  of their  low-cost subsidiaries  - Vueling,  
Transavia,  and Eurowings . It's worth  noting  that their  respective  hubs,  
Paris,  London,  and Frankfurt/Munich,  are much  closer  to each  other  
than  the hubs  of the American  counterparts . This proximity  makes  it 
easier  for the three  major  European  carriers  to divert  passengers  from  
their  competitors  than  for the three  major  Americans,  whose  distances  
leave  passengers  with  fewer  options .
As presented  earlier,  China  is experiencing  significant  growth  with  new  
airports  being  built  and new  routes  opening  every  month . Air China,  
the smallest  of the three,  is catching  up, benefiting  from  the ramp -up of 
two new  airports  in Beijing  and Chengdu,  its main  bases .
The real surprise  comes  from  the Big 3 in the Middle  East . While  
Emirates  and Etihad  made  grand  promises  during  the Dubai  Air Show,  
they  have  lost some  dynamism,  particularly  when  compared  to Qatar  
Airways . For an airline  of this scale,  we can only  applaud  the dynamism  
of its network  and the work  carried  out by Qatar  Airways'  Network  & 
Fleet  Planning  teams . Despite  the challenges  posed  by traffic  recovery,  
they  are clearly  ahead  of Emirates  and Etihad .

Can AirAsia  come  back?
Often  described  as the "pioneer"  of low-cost travel  in Asia,  AirAsia  
changed  its corporate  name  to Capital  A last year  to reflect  the 
expansion  of its business  portfolio  beyond  the core  budget  airline  : “a 
world -class  brand,  a leading  Asean  airline,  and a digital  travel  and 
lifestyle  platform  that leverages  data  and technology” … Unfortunately,  
certain  elements  are vital to the success  of a low-cost  airline : volume  
and growth  - areas  where  AirAsia  currently  faces  challenges .
In an industry  where  space  is limited  and consolidation  has already  
affected  numerous  network  carriers,  many  “Low -Cost”  carriers  have  
already  disappeared  (Go First,  Viva  Air, Swoop,  kulula .com,  NokScoot , 
Interjet , just to name  a few recent  examples …). AirAsia's  setback  due to 
the COVID  crisis  becomes  a real challenge,  especially  in the very  
dynamic  Asian  market .
Some  low-cost carriers  are not shown  here  as their  exceptional  
performances  would  make  the rest of the picture  difficult  to read!  
VivaAerobus  is one of them,  same  “size”  as AirAsia  but with  over  200% 
growth  since  2019 ... Another  example  is the Wizz  Air group . If we 
combine  the four subsidiaries  (W4, W6, W9, and 5W) – which  would  
create  a bubble  larger  than  JetBlue's  – the percentage  of seats  
deployed  on new  routes  is close  to 50%.
Others  are still too early  in their  development  to make  a definitive  
assessment  : Breeze,  Avelo , JetSMART , PLAY,  Akasa  Air, Flair,  Lynx  Air, 
Arajet , Bonza,  among  others . We monitor  all these  airlines  worldwide  
on a monthly  basis , thanks  to ch-aviation  and Milanamos , and provide  a 
competitive  assessment  using  more  than  30 benchmarks,  like this one.

Are all lessors  pursuing  the same  customer  types  ? No.
Since  COVID,  airlines  globally  have  redistributed  their  capacity  across  
each  region . These  adjustments  don't  follow  uniform  dynamics ; some  
airlines  are yet to regain  their  pre-crisis  capacity  levels,  while  others  
have  not only  fully  recovered  but have  also significantly  expanded  their  
networks .
The role of aircraft  lessors  is crucial  in this process  of readjusting  the 
newly  deployed  capacity . Taking  the A320/A321neo and 737-8 MAX  
portfolios  as examples,  we can see that lessors  don't  target  the same  
customer  types . Some  are more  focused  on high -growth  customers . 
AerCap,  ACG,  and CALC  for instance,  are actively  supporting  the 
growth  of airlines  that have  expanded  significantly  since  the crisis . In 
contrast,  lessors  like BBAM,  ORIX,  or Castlelake  have  customers  whose  
capacity  has evolved  more  moderately .
