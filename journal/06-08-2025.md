- How to patch `normalize_name()` to avoid false matches
- Getting more comfortable with pandas dataframes

### Why I Did What I Did
-Working in the airline industry, may have to deal with designing UI's for apps or websites
-People are clumsy, and careless -> find ways to streamline UX
    by eliminating potential user errors (in this form of invalid inputs)
